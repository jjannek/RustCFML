# Testing

[← Back to README](../README.md)

RustCFML's test suite is **written in CFML**, not Rust. The runner includes every test file and uses a small harness providing `assert()`, `assertTrue()`, `assertFalse()`, `assertNull()`, `assertThrows()`, `suiteBegin()`, and `suiteEnd()`.

```bash
cargo run -- tests/runner.cfm    # Full CFML test suite
cargo test                       # Rust unit tests (tag parser, pg_sql, etc.)
```

## Writing a test

1. Create `tests/<category>/test_<feature>.cfm`.
2. Use the harness:

   ```cfml
   suiteBegin("My feature");
   assert("addition", 1 + 1, 2);
   assertTrue("truthy", isNumeric(42));
   assertThrows("bad cast", function() { parseDateTime("not a date"); });
   suiteEnd();
   ```

3. Register it in `tests/runner.cfm`:

   ```cfml
   try { include "category/test_my_feature.cfm"; } catch (any e) { /* ... */ }
   ```

## Lucee is the compatibility reference

**The bar for accepting a contribution is that the test passes on Lucee.** RustCFML targets the CFML standard ([cfdocs.org](https://cfdocs.org)) with Lucee as the primary implementation target, so the same `tests/runner.cfm` is run against Lucee to verify compatibility.

Start Lucee via CommandBox (served from the project root), then hit the runner over HTTP:

```bash
box server start cfengine=lucee@7    # use @7, not @be — bleeding edge can fail to start
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:<port>/tests/runner.cfm -o /tmp/lucee_out.txt
grep -E "^(SUMMARY|FAIL \||ERROR)" /tmp/lucee_out.txt
box server status                    # shows the assigned port
box server stop
```

A green run on **both** RustCFML and Lucee is the compatibility bar. (By rare exception, where Lucee allows something genuinely unreasonable, the project may opt not to match it.)

### Writing tests that pass on both engines

- Do **not** use `var` at page scope — Lucee rejects it. Declare without `var` at page level, or wrap the test body in a function.
- Always close `<cfscript>` blocks with `</cfscript>` — Lucee's parser is strict about this.
- `tests/runner.cfm` includes `harness.cfm` once at the top; individual test files must **not** re-include it (doing so resets the harness counters and masks the grand summary).
- HTTP-dependent tests discover the port from `cgi.server_port` at request time and skip when run from the CLI with no server — don't hardcode a port.

See the project [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for more detail on the test architecture.
