# Deployment

[← Back to README](../README.md)

RustCFML deploys as a single artifact in several shapes. Two cross-cutting capabilities — **production mode** (warm caching) and the **sandbox / virtual filesystem** — apply to both web and CLI deployments and are documented at the end of this page.

## Web application

Run the built-in server behind your reverse proxy. Enable production caching for deployment:

```bash
rustcfml --serve ./mywebroot --production
```

See **[Web Server](web-server.md)** for serve-mode details, `Application.cfc` lifecycle, sessions, and URL rewriting.

## Behind a reverse proxy (nginx + Unix socket)

In production you typically run RustCFML behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, HAProxy) that terminates TLS, serves static assets, and load-balances. When the proxy and RustCFML run on the **same host** — the common single-box and containerised setup — **a Unix domain socket is the recommended way to connect them**, in preference to a loopback TCP port.

**Why a socket rather than `127.0.0.1:8500`?** When nginx proxies to RustCFML, every upstream request that isn't served from a warm keep-alive connection opens a fresh transport connection. Over loopback TCP that means the full TCP path — three-way handshake, an ephemeral source port allocated per connection, and a `TIME_WAIT` entry left behind on close. Under sustained load those add up: ephemeral ports are a finite range that can exhaust, and `TIME_WAIT` build-up adds latency and can stall new connections. A Unix domain socket sidesteps all of it — it's kernel-local IPC with no handshake, no port allocation, and no `TIME_WAIT`, so it stays flat as concurrency rises where the loopback-TCP path degrades. It also can't be reached from off-box, so the app server isn't accidentally exposed, and access is governed by ordinary filesystem permissions on the socket file. In our testing the socket path consistently matched direct-serve throughput while loopback TCP trailed it under load (see the comparison below).

Reach for loopback TCP instead only when the proxy and RustCFML are on **different hosts** (where a socket isn't an option), or when a tool in front genuinely can't address a Unix socket.

Start RustCFML on a socket:

```bash
rustcfml --serve /srv/mywebroot --production --socket /run/rustcfml.sock
```

(`--socket` overrides `--port`; a bare `--socket` defaults to `/run/rustcfml.sock`. Stale socket files are cleared on start and removed on clean shutdown — see **[Web Server → Listening](web-server.md#listening-tcp-port-or-unix-socket)**.)

Point nginx at the socket. The `keepalive` pool and `proxy_http_version 1.1` keep upstream connections warm, which matters for throughput:

```nginx
upstream rustcfml {
    server unix:/run/rustcfml.sock;
    keepalive 128;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    # Serve static assets directly from nginx; proxy everything else.
    root /srv/mywebroot;

    location / {
        try_files $uri @cfml;
    }

    location @cfml {
        proxy_pass http://rustcfml;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";              # reuse upstream keep-alive connections
        proxy_set_header Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Because Unix-socket peers have no IP, RustCFML reports `cgi.remote_addr` as `127.0.0.1`; read `X-Forwarded-For` (set above) if your application needs the real client address.

**Permissions:** the socket inherits the user/umask of the RustCFML process. nginx must be able to read/write it — run both as the same user, or `chmod`/`chown` the socket (e.g. group-accessible) so the nginx worker can connect.

### Reverse-proxy throughput

A reverse proxy costs a little raw throughput (RustCFML can serve faster when hit directly), but the proxy↔app **transport** matters: a Unix socket consistently beats TCP loopback, and the gap widens as concurrency climbs.

"Hello World" `.cfm` page, `--production` mode, Apple M-series, ApacheBench with keep-alive (`-k`), 8s runs, requests/sec — higher is better:

| Concurrency | Direct TCP (no proxy) | nginx → Unix socket | nginx → TCP loopback |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-c 1`   | 2,673 | 2,504 | 2,272 |
| `-c 10`  | 16,900 | 14,700 | 13,500 |
| `-c 50`  | 19,000 | 16,300 | 14,700 |
| `-c 100` | 19,100 | 16,600 | 11,800 |
| `-c 200` | 17,000 | 16,600 | 10,850 |

As concurrency climbs, the **Unix-socket path tracks direct-serve almost exactly while TCP loopback falls away**: at `-c 100` nginx→socket sustains ~16,600 req/s vs ~11,800 over TCP loopback (~40% more), and at `-c 200` the gap widens to ~16,600 vs ~10,850 (~53% more) — the socket path costs almost nothing over hitting RustCFML directly (~16,600 vs ~17,000), whereas TCP loopback saturates flat at ~10,850 under ephemeral-port/`TIME_WAIT` pressure. Without client keep-alive the same ordering holds (nginx→socket ~5,500 vs nginx→TCP ~4,100 at `-c 50`). Numbers are from a single dev machine and are illustrative — measure on your own hardware — but the ranking is consistent across runs.

See **[Performance](performance.md)** for the direct-serve methodology these build on.

## Docker

*Coming soon* — an optimised, minimal container image for running RustCFML web applications. Until then, a standalone web-application binary (below) copied into a `scratch`/`distroless` base works well, since RustCFML has no runtime dependencies.

## CLI tools

Build a command-line tool from a CFML app. Arguments are available via the `cli` scope, which works like CFML's `arguments` scope — named keys for flags, 1-based numeric keys for positional args.

```bash
rustcfml --build ./myapp -o greet --mode cli --entry main.cfm
```

**myapp/main.cfm:**

```cfml
<cfscript>
name = cli.name ?: "World";
writeOutput("Hello, #name#!" & chr(10));

// Positional args: cli[1], cli[2], ...
for (i = 1; i <= structCount(cli); i++) {
    if (isNumeric(i) && structKeyExists(cli, i))
        writeOutput("  arg #i#: #cli[i]#" & chr(10));
}
</cfscript>
```

```bash
./greet                     # Hello, World!
./greet --name Alex         # Hello, Alex!
./greet foo bar             # positional: cli[1]="foo", cli[2]="bar"
```

## Self-contained web binaries

Package a web application as a single binary with an embedded HTTP server — no runtime dependencies, no source files to deploy.

```bash
rustcfml --build ./webapp -o myserver --mode serve
```

```bash
./myserver                          # Foreground on port 8500
./myserver --port 3000              # Custom port
./myserver start --port 3000        # Daemonize (background)
./myserver status                   # Check if running
./myserver stop                     # Graceful shutdown
```

### Binary sizes

| Build | Size |
|---|---|
| Release binary (no app) | ~13 MB |
| + small web app | ~13 MB |
| + large app (100+ files) | ~13–15 MB |

No JRE, no runtime, no dependencies. Compare: Lucee/BoxLang require a 200+ MB JRE.

### Native (Rust) modules

Self-contained binaries can include user-authored Rust code that surfaces as first-class CFML built-ins and classes. See **[Native Modules](native-modules.md)**.

## Cloudflare Workers

Run RustCFML at the edge by compiling to WebAssembly. The Worker integration (Hyperdrive datasources, KV/R2/Durable Objects, session storage) lives in a separate repo:

- **[RustCFML-Cloudflare-worker](https://github.com/RustCFML/RustCFML-Cloudflare-worker)**

See **[WebAssembly](wasm.md)** for the WASM target generally.

## Production mode (web and CLI)

By default the server re-validates files on each request: it walks up from the page directory to find `Application.cfc`, stats the resolved file, and stats every cached bytecode entry to detect source changes. This keeps the dev loop hot — edit a file and refresh.

Passing `--production` (or setting `RUSTCFML_PRODUCTION=1`) enables three in-memory caches that persist for the server's lifetime:

- **Application.cfc path resolution** — the first request walks the directory tree; subsequent requests hit a hashmap. Negative results (no `Application.cfc` anywhere in the chain) are cached too.
- **URL → file resolution** — `is_file` stats from request routing are memoized.
- **Bytecode cache trust** — the per-hit `mtime` check on every compiled file is skipped.

Net effect: requests pay zero filesystem IO once the cache is warm — typically a 3–4× throughput gain on an app with `Application.cfc` + cfincludes. Files added or modified on disk are not picked up until the server is restarted. See **[Performance](performance.md)** for measured numbers.

## Sandbox / virtual filesystem (web and CLI)

Self-contained binaries can run in **sandbox mode**, which completely isolates the application from the host filesystem. Sandbox mode also enables production caching automatically, since the embedded VFS is immutable at runtime.

```bash
./myserver --sandbox                # No host filesystem access
./myserver --sandbox --port 3000    # Sandbox + custom port
```

In sandbox mode:

- **Embedded files are readable** — `fileRead()`, `fileExists()`, `directoryList()`, `expandPath()`, and `include` all work against the embedded virtual filesystem. Your application can read its own bundled config files, templates, and assets normally.
- **Host filesystem is invisible** — `fileExists("/etc/passwd")` returns `false`; `fileRead()` on any host path returns "file not found". The application cannot discover or read files outside the embedded archive.
- **All writes are blocked** — `fileWrite()`, `fileAppend()`, `fileDelete()`, `directoryCreate()`, and other write operations throw *"filesystem writes are disabled in sandbox mode"*.

Even if application code is compromised (e.g. via a code-injection vulnerability), the attacker cannot read sensitive host files, write persistent backdoors/web shells, or modify host files. The embedded virtual filesystem is **read-only and non-persistent** — any state the application needs to persist should use external services (databases, APIs).
