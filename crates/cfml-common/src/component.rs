//! Component-instance facade (Phase C.1).
//!
//! A CFML component instance is currently represented as a marker
//! [`CfmlValue::Struct`] carrying the private `__variables` scope plus a
//! public-scope handle (`this`) or a class name (`__name`). Historically the
//! marker predicate was open-coded in several places
//! (`is_component_struct`/`is_component_backing`/inline `contains_key_ci`
//! checks). This module is the single source of truth for "is this value a
//! component?" and the entry point ([`CfmlValue::as_component`]) that later
//! phases grow into a full read/write facade over — eventually — a dedicated
//! `Instance` backing (Phase C.2+). During C.1 it is implemented purely over
//! the existing marker struct, so it is behaviour-preserving by construction.
//!
//! NOTE: the marker predicate here (`__variables` + (`this` | `__name`)) is the
//! *component* predicate only. Deliberately NOT folded in are the *different*
//! predicates that share the `__*` idiom but mean something else — a bare
//! `__variables`-only check, the `+ __is_super` super-marker, the `+ __java_shim`
//! / `+ __java_class` Java-shim family, and the `+ __properties` class-template
//! checks. Folding those would change behaviour; they are left to their own
//! (later, separate) treatment.
