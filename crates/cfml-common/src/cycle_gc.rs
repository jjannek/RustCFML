//! Request-boundary cycle collector.
//!
//! RustCFML's reference-typed containers (`CfmlStruct`, `CfmlArray`, `CfmlQuery`)
//! and closure capture scopes (`Arc<RwLock<ValueMap>>`) are `Arc`-refcounted, so
//! a reference *cycle* (`a.other = b; b.other = a`, or a closure stored into the
//! scope it captures) is never reclaimed by refcounting alone — its internal
//! refs keep `strong_count > 0` even after every external root is gone. In a
//! long-lived `--serve` process that builds cyclic per-request graphs (Preside,
//! ColdBox, WireBox), this leaks a little on every request and RSS climbs without
//! bound.
//!
//! This module reclaims those cycles with a **request-scoped trial-deletion**
//! pass (Bacon–Rajan, bounded to one request's allocations). It does NOT replace
//! refcounting: the ~99% acyclic garbage is still freed eagerly, on-thread, with
//! zero pause. The collector only ever processes the small set of containers a
//! request allocated that are *still alive* at request end — never the whole
//! heap, never the resident persistent scopes — so there is no global
//! stop-the-world pause.
//!
//! ## How it stays correct without tracing the persistent scopes
//! The `Arc::strong_count` itself is the oracle. After the request's transient
//! roots (page `variables`, request scope, thread scope) are cleared, a survivor
//! that is still referenced from a *persistent* root (application/session/server
//! scope — which Arc-share the objects that escaped into them) has a strong count
//! greater than the number of references it gets from inside the survivor set; a
//! pure cycle does not. So we compute, per survivor `n`:
//!
//! ```text
//! external(n) = strong_count(n) − 1 (our own probe handle) − internal_in(n)
//! ```
//!
//! `external(n) > 0` ⟺ `n` has an owner outside the request's cyclic garbage ⟹
//! `n` is a live root. We mark the transitive closure of the roots live, and
//! everything else in the survivor set is an unreachable cycle: we clear its
//! backing (dropping its outgoing refs) so the whole subgraph's counts fall to
//! zero and it frees.
//!
//! ## Safety w.r.t. threads
//! Reading `strong_count` is only stable if no other thread is concurrently
//! cloning/dropping the same `Arc`. A truly-internal cycle (the only thing we
//! ever collect) is unreachable from any other request's thread by construction;
//! anything shared across threads escaped to a shared scope and thus reads as a
//! live root. The one case to guard is *this* request's own `cfthread`s, which
//! share `application`/`request` scope by Arc — the VM caller MUST skip
//! collection while `live_threads` is non-empty. See `CYCLE_GC_PLAN.md`.
