//! The VM hook bus — Phase 0 of the observability/debugging plan
//! (`docs/observability-implementation-plan.md`).
//!
//! A single, near-zero-cost event bus inside the VM that every later layer
//! (the classic debug footer, the sampling profiler, OpenTelemetry, the DAP
//! step debugger) subscribes to. The whole module is behind the
//! `observability` Cargo feature — when the feature is off the call sites in
//! the VM vanish entirely, so the hot path is byte-identical and the wasm
//! crates (which build `cfml-vm` with `default-features = false`) pay nothing.
//!
//! ## Design
//! * Each subscriber implements [`VmObserver`] and declares an [`Interest`]
//!   bitmask. The VM caches the OR of every registered observer's interest in a
//!   plain field, so a hook site is a `bitand`+branch when nobody cares about
//!   that category.
//! * Boundaries have default no-op trait methods, so a subscriber only
//!   implements the events it actually wants.
//!
//! Stage 1 wires the *non-hot* boundaries (request, query, template,
//! transaction, error, log, bif) that the classic CF debug footer needs. The
//! two hot hooks the plan calls out — `function_enter/exit` and `line` — are
//! deliberately **not** fired yet: no stage-1 subscriber needs them, and adding
//! calls to `call_function`/`LineInfo` risks the JIT-admission regressions
//! CLAUDE.md warns about. They land with the profiler/DAP (phases 2/5), whose
//! observers set the `FUNCTION`/`LINE` interest bits reserved below.
