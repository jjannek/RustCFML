//! Cloudflare Workers host glue for RustCFML.
//!
//! A Worker project depends on this crate, supplies its embedded CFML files
//! plus any KV/Hyperdrive bindings, and calls [`handle_fetch`] from its
//! `#[event(fetch)]` entry. The rest of the request lifecycle — routing,
//! cgi/url/form/cookie scope population, Application.cfc onRequestStart /
//! onRequest / onRequestEnd / onApplicationStart / onSessionStart, bytecode
//! caching, and response building — happens here.
//!
//! Native targets (`cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))`) only get the public
//! [`WorkerConfig`] struct so the crate still participates in workspace
//! `cargo build` / `cargo check`. The fetch handler itself is wasm32-only.
