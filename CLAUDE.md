# RustCFML - Claude Code Guide

## Project Overview

CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language) interpreter written in Rust. Compiles CFML source through a pipeline: **Tag Preprocessor -> Lexer -> Parser -> AST -> Bytecode Compiler -> Stack-based VM**. Inspired by RustPython.

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo build                          # Debug build
cargo build --release                # Release build
cargo run -- tests/runner.cfm        # Run all tests (~3965 assertions, 478 suites)
cargo run --release -- file.cfm      # Run a CFML file
cargo run --release -- --serve       # Start web server on port 8500
cargo test --workspace               # ALL Rust tests — incl. the JIT integration
                                     # suite crates/cfml-vm/tests/jit_numeric.rs
                                     # (76 tests). Run serial if a parallel run is
                                     # ever flaky: `-- --test-threads=1`.

# Wasm-target members — NOT built by the commands above (see warning below):
cargo build -p cfml-worker -p rustcfml-wasm --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Interactive-demo build — exercises the wasm-pack + wasm-bindgen path that the
# "Deploy Interactive Demo" GitHub Action uses (the plain cargo build above does
# NOT). Run before pushing to main. (`cargo install wasm-pack` if missing.)
wasm-pack build crates/wasm --target web
```

> 🚨 **Verification gate — a red OR skipped test in ANY suite is a release
> blocker, never a shrug.** A green `cargo build` + `tests/runner.cfm` is NOT
> sufficient. Before tagging you MUST have all of these green: `cargo test
> --workspace` (Rust + JIT integration tests), `cargo run -- tests/runner.cfm`
> (CFML, CLI **and** serve-mode cold+warm — see "Validate in serve mode"), the
> wasm build above, AND — when pushing to `main` — `wasm-pack build crates/wasm
> --target web` (the demo-deploy path; a plain `cargo build --target
> wasm32-unknown-unknown` does NOT run wasm-pack/wasm-bindgen, so it cannot catch
> a broken demo deploy — this is exactly how the v0.240.0 wasm-opt SIGSEGV slipped
> through to the "Deploy Interactive Demo" Action). If a test fails or is `#[ignore]`d, do NOT dismiss it as
> "flaky" or "unrelated" — `git bisect` to the commit that broke it and fix the
> root cause (or open a tracked issue). **This bit us hard:** a v0.137.0 codegen
> change (the PR #112 null-delete guard) silently disqualified every hot
> assignment-bearing function from JIT compilation, turning 11 of 76 JIT tests
> red — and it went unnoticed for ~20 releases (v0.137→v0.140) because the JIT
> suite wasn't being run at tag time and a green `tests/runner.cfm` masked it
> (fixed in v0.142.0). The CFML suite cannot see JIT/codegen-admission
> regressions; only `cargo test --workspace` can.

> ⚠️ **A plain `cargo build` does NOT compile the wasm32-only workspace members
> (`cfml-worker`, `rustcfml-wasm`).** They only target `wasm32-unknown-unknown`,
> so host builds silently skip them. Any change touching `CfmlValue`/`CfmlArray`/
> `CfmlStruct` (or any shared type) MUST also be verified with the
> `--target wasm32-unknown-unknown` build above before tagging — otherwise the
> Cloudflare worker build breaks for downstream consumers even though `cargo
> build`, `cargo test`, and `tests/runner.cfm` are all green. (This bit us in
> v0.33.0/v0.34.0: `CfmlArray::iter()` yielding owned values broke
> `cfml-worker`'s HyperdriveDriver; fixed in v0.34.1.) Requires the target:
> `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

> ℹ️ **Known-flaky test — `tests/stdlib/test_cfhttp.cfm`.** This suite makes
> live calls to `https://httpbin.org` (GET/POST/params), so it fails whenever
> httpbin is down, rate-limiting, or unreachable — typically surfacing as
> `ERROR | stdlib/test_cfhttp.cfm | Invalid JSON: expected value at line 1
> column 1` (an empty/non-JSON response). This is environmental, NOT a code
> regression, and only fires in serve mode (the CLI run skips it). Don't
> `git bisect` it. If it's red, re-run or confirm httpbin is up before treating
> it as a blocker. (Engine-side cfhttp coverage that does NOT depend on the
> public internet lives in `tests/tags/test_cfhttp_attribute_collection.cfm`
> and `tests/tags/test_tags_cfhttp_interpolation.cfm`, which hit the local
> `tests/tags/http_statements_target.cfm` echo endpoint.)

Tests are CFML-based, not Rust-based. The test runner (`tests/runner.cfm`) includes all test files and uses the harness (`tests/harness.cfm`) which provides `assert()`, `assertTrue()`, `assertFalse()`, `assertNull()`, `assertThrows()`, `suiteBegin()`, `suiteEnd()`.

### Cross-engine testing (Lucee)

The same test suite runs against Lucee to verify compatibility with the reference engine. Start Lucee via CommandBox (served out of the project root), then hit `tests/runner.cfm` over HTTP:

```bash
box server start cfengine=lucee@be   # starts Lucee on a CommandBox-assigned port (e.g. 127.0.0.1:8585)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8585/tests/runner.cfm -o /tmp/lucee_out.txt
grep -E "^(SUMMARY|FAIL \||ERROR)" /tmp/lucee_out.txt
box server status                    # show port if you don't see it in startup output
box server stop                      # shut it down
```

**Writing tests that pass on both engines:**
- Do NOT use `var` at page scope — Lucee rejects it ("Unsupported Context for Local Scope"). Declare without `var` at page level, or wrap the test body in a function.
- Always close `<cfscript>` blocks with `</cfscript>` — Lucee's parser is strict about this; RustCFML tolerates EOF.
- The test runner includes `harness.cfm` once at the top. Individual test files must NOT re-include it, because the harness body resets `request._test_total*` counters and masks the grand summary.
- HTTP-dependent tests (`tests/tags/test_tags_cfscript_statements.cfm`) discover the port from `cgi.server_port` (set by the server at request-time) and skip the HTTP subtests when the runner is invoked from the CLI with no server available. Don't hardcode a port.
- Lucee and RustCFML both run through the same `tests/runner.cfm`, so a green run on both is the compatibility bar.

### Compilation Pipeline

1. **Tag Preprocessor** (`tag_parser.rs`): Converts `<cfset x=1>` style tags to CFScript (`x=1;`). All CFML tags become function calls or script constructs. Body tags use `find_closing_tag` to extract content.

2. **Lexer** (`lexer.rs`): Tokenizes CFScript source. Tokens defined in `token.rs`.

3. **Parser** (`parser.rs`): Recursive descent parser producing AST nodes defined in `ast.rs`.

4. **Codegen** (`compiler.rs`): Walks AST and emits `BytecodeOp` instructions defined in `bytecode.rs`.

5. **VM** (`lib.rs`): Stack-based execution engine. The main loop is `execute_function_with_args()` which processes bytecode ops.

## Key Patterns

### Adding a New Built-in Function

**Simple (pure function, no VM state needed):**
1. Register in `builtins.rs` → `get_builtin_functions()` with section comment
2. Implement as `fn fn_name(args: Vec<CfmlValue>) -> CfmlResult`

**VM-intercepted (needs access to VM state like output_buffer, globals, closures):**
1. Register a stub in `builtins.rs` that returns an error
2. Add the function name (lowercase) to the intercept list in `lib.rs` `call_function()` (~line 1718)
3. Add the handler in `call_function()` after the intercept check

Examples of VM-intercepted: `writeOutput`, `writeDump`, `sleep`, `include`, all higher-order functions (arrayMap, structFilter, etc.), savecontent, cfthread.

### Adding a New CFML Tag

1. Add the tag name match arm in `tag_parser.rs` → `tags_to_script_impl()`
2. Convert to CFScript equivalent (function call, block, or statement)
3. Body tags: use `find_closing_tag(chars, tag_end, len, "tagname")` to find `</cftagname>`
4. For tags needing VM support: register stub functions + add VM intercepts (see cfthread, cfsavecontent patterns)

### Adding a New Operator

1. Add token variant in `token.rs`
2. Add lexer recognition in `lexer.rs`
3. Add parser handling in `parser.rs` (check precedence level)
4. Add AST node if needed in `ast.rs`
5. Add codegen in `compiler.rs` → emit bytecode ops
6. Add VM handling in `lib.rs` if new bytecode op

### Adding Tests

1. Create `tests/<category>/test_<feature>.cfm`
2. Use the harness: `suiteBegin("Name")`, `assert("label", actual, expected)`, `suiteEnd()`
3. Add `try { include "category/test_file.cfm"; } catch ...` line in `tests/runner.cfm`

### Native (Rust) modules

Users can extend a self-contained binary with first-class Rust BIFs and classes. The plumbing:

- `CfmlValue::NativeObject(Arc<RwLock<dyn CfmlNative>>)` in `cfml-common/src/dynamic.rs`. The `CfmlNative` trait (`Send + Sync + Debug`) exposes `class_name()` + `call_method(name, args)`, with optional `get_property`/`set_property` (default-impls return None) for CFC `this.X` fall-through.
- `vm.register_native_fn(name, f)` and `vm.register_native_class(name, ctor)` (`cfml-vm/src/lib.rs`).
- **Query-of-Queries** lives in `crates/cfml-qoq/` (pure-Rust SQL `SELECT` engine; no JDBC). `queryExecute(sql, params, {dbtype:"query"})` is VM-intercepted in `lib.rs` (`execute_qoq`): it parses, resolves the referenced query variables from scope, `mem::take`s `qoq_registry` (so the CFML-UDF callback can borrow `&mut self` via `call_function`), runs `cfml_qoq::execute`, then restores. Engine design: one `eval` with a `RowCtx` (Row vs Group) is the dual-path evaluator; `intersection.rs` folds joins into 1-based row-index vectors (0 = NULL sentinel). Extend SQL functions in `cfml-qoq/src/functions.rs` (scalars) / `execution.rs` (aggregates). `vm.register_native_qoq_fn(name, f, QoQFnKind::Scalar|Aggregate)` exposes a native fn as both a BIF and a QoQ function; `queryRegisterFunction(name, udf[, "aggregate"])` registers a CFML UDF for use in SQL. RustCFML is a BoxLang-faithful superset of Lucee QoQ — see `docs/known-issues.md` §9.
- `createObject("rust", "Name", ...)` consults `vm.native_classes` before falling through. Method dispatch short-circuits in `call_member_function()` for `NativeObject`.
- CFC inheritance from a Rust class: `component extends="rust:Name" { ... }`. `resolve_inheritance_chain` (`cfml-vm/src/lib.rs`) detects the `rust:` prefix and stashes `__rust_extends`; `attach_native_parent` default-constructs the parent into `__super`. `super(args)` inside `init` is compiled to `BytecodeOp::CallRustSuperCtor` which re-runs the registered ctor. `super.X` and unqualified method fall-through both reach the native parent. `this.X` reads/writes route through `CfmlNative::get_property`/`set_property` when CFC has no such key.
- The `rustcfml-cli` crate is lib+bin. Library exposes `set_registrar` / `run_with_registrar` so externally-generated `main.rs` can inject modules.
- `rustcfml --build` runs the "cocktail" path when a project contains `native/<crate>/Cargo.toml`: generates a synthetic Cargo workspace under `.rustcfml-cocktail/`, path-deps on `rustcfml-cli` + each user module, shells out to `cargo build --release`, then appends the VFS archive to the produced binary. Plain CFML apps with no `native/` directory stay on the toolchain-free bundling path.
- The smoke-test in `crates/cli/src/main.rs` is gated on `RUSTCFML_NATIVE_SMOKE_TEST=1` and exercises `tests/native/*.cfm` end-to-end without needing the full cocktail build.
- Working example: `examples/native_module_demo/`. Module author contract documented in its README.

## Important Conventions

- **Case-insensitive**: All CFML identifiers, function names, scope keys are case-insensitive. Use `.to_lowercase()` or `eq_ignore_ascii_case()` for comparisons.
- **IndexMap, not HashMap**: Use `IndexMap<String, CfmlValue>` for ordered key-value structures (structs, scopes). `HashMap` only for internal lookups (builtins, user_functions).
- **CfmlValue**: The core enum — `Null`, `Boolean(bool)`, `Int(i64)`, `Double(f64)`, `String(String)`, `Array(Vec<CfmlValue>)`, `Struct(IndexMap<String, CfmlValue>)`, `Function(CfmlFunction)`, `Query(...)`, `Binary(Vec<u8>)`, `Component(...)`.
- **CfmlResult**: `Result<CfmlValue, CfmlError>`. Functions return `Ok(CfmlValue::Null)` for void operations.
- **1-based arrays**: CFML arrays are 1-based. Convert to 0-based for Rust Vec access.
- **Output buffering**: `self.output_buffer` collects all output. `saved_output_buffers` is a stack for nested capture (cfsavecontent, cfsilent, cfthread).
- **Closure scope capture**: Closures carry `captured_scope: Option<Arc<RwLock<IndexMap>>>`. Sibling closures share the same Arc. Write-back propagates mutations to parent scope.

## Scope Resolution Order

Variable lookup checks scopes in CFML-standard order: `local` -> `arguments` -> `thread` (inside cfthread) -> `variables` -> `cgi` -> `url` -> `form` -> `cookie` -> `request` -> `application` -> `server` -> `session`.

Explicit scope prefix (`variables.x`, `request.x`) bypasses the search chain.

## Common Gotchas

- `lib.rs` and `builtins.rs` are very large files (~7k and ~10k lines). Use grep to find specific handlers rather than reading the whole file.
- The VM intercept pattern means some "builtin" functions are actually handled in `lib.rs`, not `builtins.rs`. Always check both.
- Tag preprocessing happens before parsing — the parser only sees CFScript. Debug tag issues by checking the tag_parser output first.
- Query column access via dot notation (`q.name`) returns an Array of column values. Bracket notation (`q["name"]`) is different.
- The `request` scope persists across includes within a single execution — tests use it for state (harness counters).

## Git Commit Style

Short, descriptive first line summarizing the change. Examples from history:
```
