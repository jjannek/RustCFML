## Project Aims

RustCFML aims to be a **compatible, fast, run-anywhere** CFML engine with a minimal memory footprint and maximum performance. It is deliberately opinionated:

- **A lean, stable core.** We don't add things to the core that are prone to constant churn in the wider ecosystem. Reliability comes first — think of RustCFML as an LTS-style engine. It is already blazingly fast.
- **Libraries over built-ins.** We won't add core functions that are better served by libraries. Instead, where possible, we make the engine compatible enough to *run* those libraries.
- **No administrator, ever.** RustCFML does not have — and never will have — a ColdFusion Administrator. Configuration is file-based via [`.cfconfig.json`](docs/configuration.md), with environment-variable substitution for secrets.
- **Inspired by real apps and modern deployment.** We follow modern deployment practices and won't bake in CI/CD features that belong in your pipeline, not your language runtime.
- **Honest about Java.** There is no JVM under the hood. We provide limited [Java-class shim support](docs/java-shims.md) (faking common Java classes), but you should expect — and will find — differences.

## Project Background

RustCFML began as a proof of AI model capabilities by Alex Skinner, CEO of [Pixl8 Group](https://www.pixl8.co.uk/). It has been written almost entirely by AI — predominantly Claude Opus — with research and test synthesis assisted by local models.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to start is with a prebuilt binary — no toolchain required.

1. **Download a binary** for your platform from the **[latest release](https://github.com/RustCFML/RustCFML/releases/latest)** (Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS aarch64), then put it on your `PATH`:

   ```bash
   chmod +x rustcfml-macos-aarch64
   sudo mv rustcfml-macos-aarch64 /usr/local/bin/rustcfml
   ```

2. **Run a web application** — the most common way to get going. Point RustCFML at a directory of `.cfm` files:

   ```bash
   rustcfml --serve ./mywebroot --port 8500
   ```

   It serves `.cfm` pages and static assets, runs the `Application.cfc` lifecycle, and supports sessions, URL rewriting, and file uploads. See **[Web Server](docs/web-server.md)**.

3. **Go to production** — add `--production` to enable warm in-memory caching (skips per-request filesystem checks for a 3–4× throughput gain):

   ```bash
   rustcfml --serve ./mywebroot --production
   ```

   See **[Deployment](docs/deployment.md)** for production mode, the sandbox/virtual filesystem, standalone binaries, and Cloudflare Workers.

You can also run a single template (`rustcfml myapp.cfm`), drop into a REPL (`rustcfml -r`), or run inline code (`rustcfml -c '...'`). See **[Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)** for those and shebang scripts.

## Performance

RustCFML compiles to a native binary with no runtime VM overhead, so it starts instantly and serves requests with a fraction of the memory of JVM-based CFML engines.

Serving a "Hello World" `.cfm` page in `--production` mode against a warmed Lucee 7 — same machine (Apple M-series), same page, Apache Bench, 8s runs. Requests/sec, higher is better:

| Concurrency | RustCFML | Lucee 7.0 | RustCFML (keep-alive) | Lucee (keep-alive) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `-c 1`   | **1,908** | 1,205 | **3,118**  | 1,625 |
| `-c 10`  | **5,466** | 2,648 | **21,716** | 8,125 |
| `-c 50`  | **6,983** | 3,503 | **25,833** | 8,085 |
| `-c 100` | **7,528** | 3,107 | **25,855** | 7,419 |

| | RustCFML | Lucee 7.0 |
|---|---|---|
| **Memory (RSS, under load)** | **~60 MB** | ~560 MB |
| **Startup** | **instant** | ~15s |

RustCFML serves roughly 2–3.5× the throughput at about a tenth of the memory, with no JVM warmup. Both engines benefit from HTTP keep-alive; RustCFML scales further with it, sustaining ~26,000 req/s. See **[Performance](docs/performance.md)** for full methodology and production-mode caching.

### Query-of-Queries

Running [bdw429s/cfml-qoq-perf-tests](https://github.com/bdw429s/cfml-qoq-perf-tests) — 10 representative SELECTs against a 1M-row in-memory `employees` query — in serve mode, 5-run median, same machine, lower is better:

| Engine | Total (ms) | RustCFML speedup |
|---|---:|---:|
| **RustCFML** v0.112 | **1,116** | — |
| BoxLang 1.14 | 1,368 | **1.23× faster** |
| Lucee 7.0.4 | 7,884 | **7.1× faster** |

RustCFML wins six of ten queries outright (and the total), including the 5×UNION DISTINCT and the grouped-aggregate cases. Pure-Rust SQL engine in `crates/cfml-qoq` — no JDBC, no HSQLDB, parallelised across cores with rayon (non-wasm).

## Deployment

RustCFML is designed to deploy as a single artifact in several shapes — see **[Deployment](docs/deployment.md)** for full detail:

- **Web application** — run `--serve` behind your reverse proxy, with `--production` for warm in-memory caching:

  ```bash
  rustcfml --serve ./mywebroot --production
  ```

  On the same host as the proxy, bind a **Unix domain socket** with `--socket` instead of a TCP port — it skips loopback TCP and sustains ~40% more throughput than TCP loopback at high concurrency. See **[Deployment → Behind a reverse proxy (nginx + Unix socket)](docs/deployment.md#behind-a-reverse-proxy-nginx--unix-socket)**.

- **Optimised Docker container** — *coming soon*: a minimal image for containerised deployment.

- **CLI tool** — compile a CFML app into a standalone command-line binary. See **[Deployment → CLI tools](docs/deployment.md#cli-tools)**.

- **Cloudflare Workers** — run RustCFML at the edge via WebAssembly. See **[RustCFML-Cloudflare-worker](https://github.com/RustCFML/RustCFML-Cloudflare-worker)**.

**Production mode** (warm caching) and **sandbox / virtual filesystem** (host isolation, embedded files) apply to both web and CLI deployments — they're documented once in **[Deployment](docs/deployment.md)**.

## Features

- **Complete CFML language** — CFScript and tag syntax (a preprocessor converts 50+ tags to CFScript), components with inheritance and interfaces, closures, member functions, and higher-order functions across arrays, structs, queries, and lists.
- **400+ built-in functions** — strings, arrays, structs, dates, math, lists, queries, JSON, XML, regex, encoding, hashing, and modern password hashing (bcrypt/scrypt/argon2).
- **Batteries-included web server** — `Application.cfc` lifecycle, [sessions](docs/sessions.md) (in-process, Memcached, or clustered), cookies, authentication, URL rewriting, and file uploads.
- **Data & integration** — `queryExecute` over SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MSSQL with pooling and `cftransaction`; in-memory **Query-of-Queries** (`dbtype="query"`) on a pure-Rust SQL engine — see the perf table below; `cfhttp`; `cfmail`; and S3-compatible object storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO).
- **Real concurrency** — `cfthread` runs bodies on real OS threads with shared `application`/`request`/`session` scopes and `cflock`. See **[Threading](docs/threads.md)**.
- **Native WebSockets** — realtime channels on the same port as HTTP: one CFC per channel with convention lifecycle methods, rooms, presence, auth, `lastEventId` resumability, multi-node fan-out, ack-by-return, and emit-from-anywhere (`wsPublish`/`io()`) — reachable over both **raw WebSocket** and the **socket.io** transport, plus an imperative **socket.io-lucee-compatible** API (`new SocketIoServer()`). See **[WebSockets](docs/websockets.md)**.
- **Run anywhere** — native binaries, self-contained single-file apps, and a WebAssembly target that runs on Cloudflare Workers.
- **Extensible** — drop in first-class built-ins and classes written in Rust ([native modules](docs/native-modules.md)).

See **[Compatibility & Status](docs/status.md)** for implementation status.

### Not Supported

- Image functions, Spreadsheet functions, ORM, SOAP/WSDL, Flash/Flex, PDF, LDAP, Registry
- `cfschedule`, `cfwddx`

For documented gaps, silent no-ops, and Lucee/BoxLang divergences, see **[Known Issues](docs/known-issues.md)**.

## Threading

`<cfthread>` bodies run on **real OS threads** — concurrently, on separate cores — not sequentially inline. `action="join"` blocks until a thread (or, with no `name`, all threads) completes; results land in `cfthread.NAME` (`status`, `output`, `error`, `elapsedtime`, plus the body's `thread` scope). `application`, `server`, `session`, and `request` scopes are **shared live** across threads (guard concurrent writes with `cflock`); `variables` is **copied at spawn**, and data is passed in via the thread's `attributes`. An error in a thread sets its status to `TERMINATED` without aborting the parent.

Two deliberate differences from Lucee, both arising from doing threading safely in Rust:

- **`terminate` is cooperative, not forceful.** Rust can't safely kill a running thread mid-instruction (it could leave locks held or memory half-written — the reason Java deprecated `Thread.stop()`). Instead, `terminate` sets a flag the body checks at loop back-edges and then aborts. A thread spinning in a loop stops promptly; one parked in a single long call (`sleep`, a slow query) won't notice until it returns to a loop. It's a difference in responsiveness, not correctness.
- **A `cftransaction` can't span the parent↔child boundary.** Its live DB connection can't be used from another thread, so a spawned thread starts with no transaction — its queries aren't part of one the parent has open, and a parent rollback won't undo them. Keep transactional work within a single thread.

Full detail, scope tables, and examples: **[Threading](docs/threads.md)**.

## Architecture

```plaintext
CFML Source (.cfm / .cfc)
    → Tag Preprocessor → CFScript → Lexer → Parser → AST → Compiler → Bytecode → VM → Output
```

RustCFML is a Cargo workspace of focused crates (`cfml-common`, `cfml-compiler`, `cfml-codegen`, `cfml-vm`, `cfml-stdlib`, `cli`, `wasm`). See **[Architecture](docs/architecture.md)** for the full breakdown.

## Building from Source

If you'd rather build it yourself (or you're contributing), you need Rust stable (>= 1.75.0) — install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RustCFML/RustCFML.git
cd RustCFML
cargo build --release        # binary at target/release/rustcfml
cargo install --path crates/cli   # optional: install on your PATH
```

See **[Getting Started → Building from source](docs/getting-started.md#building-from-source)** for feature flags, the WebAssembly target, and the self-contained-binary build path.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

- **New here?** If you haven't contributed before, please **[open an Issue](https://github.com/RustCFML/RustCFML/issues)** with detail (a minimal reproducible CFML snippet, expected vs actual behaviour) before opening a PR.
- **Pull requests are the preferred way to contribute a fix.** A great place to start is a **CFML-based test** that demonstrates the behaviour (see **[Testing](docs/testing.md)**).
- **Lucee is the reference for compatibility.** Your test **must pass on Lucee** — if it doesn't, we won't accept it. RustCFML targets [cfdocs.org](https://cfdocs.org) with Lucee as the primary implementation target. (By rare exception, where Lucee allows something genuinely unreasonable, we may choose not to match it.)

See **[Testing](docs/testing.md)** for how to run the suite against both RustCFML and Lucee.
