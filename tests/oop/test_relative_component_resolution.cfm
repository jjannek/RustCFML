suiteBegin("OOP: relative (bare) component name resolution");

// Background: A bare (unqualified) component name in
// createObject("component", "Sibling") -- or new Sibling() -- must resolve
// relative to the CALLING CFC's package first. Maker lives in oop.relcomp
// alongside Sibling, so from inside Maker the bare name "Sibling" should
// find oop.relcomp.Sibling. RustCFML 0.153.0 did not search the caller
// package and threw "Could not find the component [Sibling]" -- viaCreate()
// caught it and returned "ERR:...". Lucee/ACF/BoxLang return the sibling
// marker "SIBLING-OK". Fixed in v0.160.0 by swapping source_file to the
// receiving instance's own package for the duration of a method call.
//
// This was the deepest blocker for the Wheels migrator TableDefinition DSL:
// createTable / t.string / t.integer / t.references / t.timestamps / t.create
// and changeTable / addColumn all route through relative createObject of
// sibling migrator components.
//
// The `new Sibling()` spelling has the identical resolution path and is now
// fixed too, but on RustCFML a resolution failure there is UNCATCHABLE
// (escapes try/catch and would abort the file), so it is intentionally NOT
// asserted here -- only the catchable, runner-safe createObject form is. The
// dotted control is resolved from THIS (test-docroot) scope, not from inside
// Maker, because a dotted path is itself resolved relative to the caller
// package.

relcompMaker = createObject("component", "oop.relcomp.Maker").init();

// Control: fully-qualified resolution works on RustCFML and Lucee alike.
// Resolved from the test docroot scope (not from inside Maker).
controlSibling = "?";
try {
    controlSibling = createObject("component", "oop.relcomp.Sibling").hi();
} catch (any e) {
    controlSibling = "ERR:" & e.message;
}
assert(
    "qualified createObject('component','oop.relcomp.Sibling') resolves (control)",
    controlSibling,
    "SIBLING-OK"
);

// Gap: bare name via createObject, called from inside Maker, must resolve
// against Maker's own package (oop.relcomp).
assert(
    "bare createObject('component','Sibling') resolves relative to caller package",
