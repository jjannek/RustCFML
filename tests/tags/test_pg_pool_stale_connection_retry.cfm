// PostgreSQL pooled connections must recover when the server closes a session
// behind the pool (Neon scale-to-zero / suspend-resume, failover, or a
// pg_terminate_backend / smart shutdown).
//
// RustCFML deliberately does not ping SELECT 1 on every checkout, matching
// Lucee's default datasource behaviour and avoiding an extra remote round-trip.
// A pooled connection whose backend died while idle is therefore handed out and
// the first real query fails — either with a closed socket (is_closed) or a
// server FATAL ("terminating connection due to administrator command"). The
// runtime must mark it broken, discard it, and retry the (side-effect-free)
// statement on a fresh connection.
//
// A single retry is NOT enough: min_idle keeps a spare healthy connection that
// masks the first kill, and when several sessions die at once the pool holds
// multiple dead connections that r2d2 replaces asynchronously. This test kills
// the connection it just used on each round, so by the second round the pool
// must drain a genuinely dead connection — which only succeeds with the bounded
// drain-and-retry loop plus FATAL-state detection.
//
// Live test, gated on RUSTCFML_TEST_PG_URL. To run locally:
//   docker run --rm -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres postgres:16
//   RUSTCFML_TEST_PG_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres \
//     cargo run -- tests/runner.cfm
