    Background
    ============================================================
    The tag form <cftry> ... <cfcatch> ... <cffinally> ... </cftry> transpiles
    to a CFScript try/catch/finally. On Lucee 5/6/7, Adobe ColdFusion, and
    BoxLang the finally block parses and always runs (after normal completion
    and after a caught exception).

    On RustCFML the whitespace (newlines/indentation) between </cfcatch> and
    <cffinally> -- and between a <cftry> body and <cffinally> -- was emitted as
    __writeText(...) into the structural gap of the generated try statement,
    producing "} __writeText(); finally {" which fails to parse. Only a
    single-line form with no inter-tag whitespace happened to work; every
    normally-formatted try/catch/finally did not compile.

    Because that is a hard PARSE error (and a parse error escapes try/catch and
    would abort the whole runner), the cases live in runtime-instantiated
    fixture CFCs -- the same pattern as test_tag_attribute_interpolation.cfm /
    test_component_declaration_attributes.cfm. An unparseable fixture makes
    createObject() throw "Could not find the component"; loadRun() catches that
    and returns the message, so the gap shows as a clean failed assertion rather
    than taking down the run. The fixtures are deliberately multi-line: a
    single-line fixture would parse even on the unfixed engine and hide the gap.

    Why it matters for Moopa: code/moopa/lib/cloudflare_stream.cfc (uploadCaptionVtt)
    uses a <cffinally> block to delete its temp upload file; the parse failure
    made /moopa/lib/cloudflare_stream "not found".
