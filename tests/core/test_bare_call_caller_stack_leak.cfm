suiteBegin("Core: bare-name method calls ignore caller-stack frames (no dynamic scoping)");

// Background
// ----------
// Inside a CFC method, a function called by BARE NAME resolves against the
// method's own frame and then the component's variables/this scope — NEVER
// against the arguments/locals of ANCESTOR frames on the call stack. CFML is
// lexically scoped: a caller's parameter or local that happens to share a
// name with a component method is pure data and must stay invisible to a
// callee's function-name resolution. Lucee 5/6/7, Adobe CF, and BoxLang all
// agree (all six probe calls succeed on Lucee 5.4.8.2).
//
// RustCFML 0.108.0 resolves bare-name calls through the caller stack
// (dynamic scoping): if ANY ancestor frame holds a non-function value under
// the function's name, the callee's bare call throws "Variable is not a
// function or function '<unknown>' is not defined". The shadowing cascades
// through the WHOLE stack — a grandparent's param breaks a grandchild's
// call. Locals shadow too, not just params. `variables.fn()` and `this.fn()`
// are immune on 0.108.0 (fix-shape hint: bare-name resolution should consult
// the same scopes, functions-before-ancestor-data, frame-isolated).
//
// Likely the same frame-fusion family as the per-frame `local` gaps
// (test_local_scope_frame_isolation.cfm and the absence-leak test filed
// alongside this one): frames are not isolated, so name lookups fall through
// to ancestor frames. Fixing frame-isolated name resolution may collapse
// several of these at once.
//
// Surfaced booting Wheels: the $invokeOnSelf trampoline takes a param named
// `$args`, and it sits above every controller action. Every bare `$args(...)`
// call in ANY framework function below it on the stack — redirectTo()'s URL
// building among them — hit the leak and died "Variable is not a function":
// every POST redirect 500'd. Latent landmine: any param/local name matching
// any function called bare anywhere below it on the stack.

//     both engines; guards the wiring.

//     both bare calls in the grandchild must still resolve.

//     stack (green on both engines, including RustCFML 0.108.0).
