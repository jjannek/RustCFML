// Fixture: a try/catch whose catch clause names the exception type as a QUOTED
// string literal (a dotted custom type that is not a bare identifier). On
// Lucee/Adobe CF/BoxLang the catch type may be written as a quoted string, which
// is how you catch a namespaced custom exception. Wheels uses this on the boot
// path — e.g. vendor/wheels/Public.cfc: catch ("Wheels.Packages.RegistryUnavailable" e)
// and vendor/wheels/auth/JwtStrategy.cfc: catch ("Wheels.Auth.JWT.TokenExpired" e).
// (Originally from PR #32 by bpamiri.)
